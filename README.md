**Description**  
A simple top-down 2D game demo made using the Unity Engine.  
Player movement and interactable object detection are scripted with C#.  
Animations for player and [E] interaction indicator were created using Unity's built-in animator.  
A sound will play when the user interacts with an object, like a sign or a door.  

**Credits**  
Sounds are created using Audacity. <br />
Sign texture and [E] interaction indicator created using Photopea.  
All other textures are from itch.io public game assets.  

**Controls**  
WASD - Move Player  
LShift - Sprint  
E - Interact w/ Object  

**How to Play**
